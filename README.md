### Hi there 👋

<!--
Energy, security and innovation can propel the human race into the next evolutionary phase. Moving our planet forward in a way that is practical, responsible and safe is our mission.

The energy sector is long overdue for transformational advancement. The world has struggled for many years to bring a viable alternative to outdated resources like coal, oil and natural gas. As you can see with the graph to the right we have added 20,000 TWh with all other energy advancements in the last 20 years. Avid Innovations aims to change the paradigm to “alternative” energy making it “primary” energy for the present and future generations of this world.

Alternative, emission-free energy sources are undeniably the future of our planet’s energy landscape, offering a sustainable and environmentally responsible solution to the growing energy demands of our society. Avid Innovations is at the forefront of this transformative journey towards a cleaner and greener future. Their visionary approach not only focuses on harnessing these resources efficiently but also on developing advanced energy storage solutions to ensure a constant and reliable supply of clean energy. Through research, development, and a dedication to sustainability, Avid Innovations is leading the charge towards a world where emissions are reduced to zero, and our energy needs are met with eco-friendly alternatives, making our planet a healthier and more sustainable place for future generations.

“At Avid Innovations, our mission is to safeguard individuals, organizations, and communities from emerging threats and vulnerabilities in an ever-evolving security landscape. We are committed to delivering cutting-edge security and threat detection solutions that empower our clients to proactively identify, mitigate, and respond to risks effectively.”

Avid Innovations is developing technology to change the paradigm of threat detection and security. The screening machines currently implemented play a crucial role in maintaining security and safety in various environments, including airports, government buildings, schools, public events, and critical infrastructure sites. The specific machines used may vary depending on the level of security required and the nature of the screening process.
